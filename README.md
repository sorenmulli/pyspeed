# Python implementations speed test
A project concerned with comparing speeds of different python low-level language integrations.

## Tested implementations

### Pure python
Using core python language features and nothing else.

### Numpy
Using built in functions from the numpy library

### CPU PyTorch
Using built in function from pytorch library on cpu

### Cython pure
Compiling the pure python script as a cython library and importing it

### Cython C
Adding cython (C) language features to the pure python implementation.

## Test cases

### Rootloop
Compute the sum of the square root of every even number up to N.

## Setup
Build both cython implementations (see their src folders)
