# Python implementations speed test
A project concerned with comparing speeds of different python low-level language integrations.

## Tested implementations

### Pure python
Using core python language features and nothing else.

## Test cases

### Loops
A silly double for loop that computes $N^2 \cdot (N-1)$.
