# Python implementations speed test
A project concerned with comparing speeds of different python low-level language integrations.

## Tested implementations

### Pure python
Using core python language features and nothing else.

### Numpy
Using built in functions from the numpy library

### CPU PyTorch
Using built in function from pytorch library on cpu

## Test cases

### Rootloop
Compute the sum of the square root of every even number up to N.
